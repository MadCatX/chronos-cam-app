# This file processes the Â«clipÂ» regions in our *.ui files. It just copies and
# pastes text around, as a very simple preprocessor. It is needed because, when
# we are laying out a .ui file in Qt Designer, we need to see some things like
# margins and fonts so we can actually design the layout in a way that looks
# anything like what the final product on the camera will be. This is essential
# to the new UI look as it uses styles to enlarge most element's click targets.
#
# Differences are not resolved. However, the md5sum exists to keep work from
# lost inadvertently.
# 
# Replacement Syntax:
# 	Start of region: a line containing something like 
# 	Â«begin clip from "project-relative source file" (optional md5 sum)Â»
# 	
# 	End of region: a line containing
# 	Â«end clip regionÂ».
#
# The contents between these two declarations are replaced by the source file.
# Search the project for "begin clip" for examples. ðŸ™‚
#
# Design Remarks:
# The process goes through each step separately, so that it can detect and print
# the errors all at once. It should also allow us to do things like only read
# files once if we need to, or update the source file if only the destination
# file has changed. The downside is that we do require a fair bit of memory to
# hold the results of each step.
# We can't use traditional 'render to file' methods here, such as an XML
# External Entity processor. We need to edit the .ui files with the external
# reference subbed-in, in QT Creator. However, we need the .ui files to also
# have the external reference, so we can include snippets of CSS across the
# whole project. I couldn't find a general solution to inline the clip regions
# alongside their content. The solution was to write a little scr
